This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

To set up React Testing Library, Jest, and Axios in a React project that uses import aliases via Webpack, you need to configure Jest to understand these aliases so that it can properly resolve modules during testing. Here’s how to configure your project step-by-step, including handling import aliases:

### 1. Overview of Tools

The tools and their purposes remain the same as previously described. The main focus here is ensuring that Jest can resolve the same import aliases that Webpack does.

### 2. Installing Necessary Packages

First, ensure you have React, Jest, React Testing Library, Axios, and any necessary Babel plugins installed:

yarn add axios
yarn add --dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest babel-jest

### 3. Configuring Jest with Alias Support

To configure Jest to resolve the same aliases as Webpack, you will need to use a package like babel-plugin-module-resolver or modify the Jest configuration directly. Here’s how to do it using babel-plugin-module-resolver:

First, install the plugin:

yarn add --dev babel-plugin-module-resolver

Then, update your Babel configuration (e.g., in babel.config.js) to include the plugin with configuration matching your Webpack aliases:

module.exports = {
presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
plugins: [
['module-resolver', {
root: ['./src'],
alias: {
"@components": "./src/components",
"@utils": "./src/utils",
// Add other aliases as per your webpack config
}
}]
],
};

Adjust the aliases to match those specified in your Webpack configuration.

### 4. Configuring Jest

In jest.config.js, you will need to ensure that Jest uses the Babel settings:

module.exports = {
setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'],
transform: {
'^.+\\.[t|j]sx?$': 'babel-jest', // Transform JS and JSX files
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^@components/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/components/$1",
    "^@utils/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/utils/$1",
// Add other aliases to match your Babel configuration
},
testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
};

This configuration ensures Jest understands how to resolve the aliases. moduleNameMapper uses regex patterns to map aliases to their respective directories in your project structure.

### 5. Mocking Axios

You should still mock Axios to ensure your tests do not make real HTTP requests. Create a global mock in the **mocks** directory as described in the previous response or mock it within individual test files:

// In your test file
jest.mock('axios');

### 6. Example Test Using Aliases and Axios

Here’s how you might write a test for a component using an alias and making an Axios call:

import React from 'react';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import axios from 'axios';
import MyComponent from '@components/MyComponent'; // Using an alias

jest.mock('axios');

test('component fetches and displays data', async () => {
axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { message: 'Hello World' } });
render(<MyComponent />);
await waitFor(() => screen.getByText('Hello World'));
});
